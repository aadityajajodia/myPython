In this repository all I am trying to do is write some simple python programs and upload it here.
All these codes area based on simple questions which i came or coming across in my second year in Manipal Institute of Technology.
Hopefully this will be helpfull
Also those interested please contribute and help students learn more.
for that simply write python code and mention your question in the commit.

Happy coding
